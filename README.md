Satellite-derived nighttime lights have become a widely used proxy for electricity access and energy system performance in the Global South, where administrative and survey-based data are often incomplete or unreliable (Pei et al. 2025, Dong et al. 2025). Recent peer-reviewed studies show that brightness levels and temporal changes in nighttime lights are strongly associated with household electrification, grid expansion, and large-scale disruptions to electricity supply (Bhattarai et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2015). Building on earlier work linking nightlights to economic activity, newer research emphasizes temporal variability in brightness as an indicator of electricity reliability rather than access alone, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (Masud Ali et al. 2024).

Most existing studies focus on estimating electricity access levels or tracking long-run electrification progress. Fewer papers examine whether patterns in nightlight variability over time can be used to distinguish broadly stable from unstable electricity systems in a comparative, cross-country framework. This project builds on the established use of nighttime lights as an energy proxy while addressing this gap. Specifically, we ask whether patterns in nighttime satellite images can distinguish countries with relatively stable versus variable electricity-related lighting over time. We analyze monthly nighttime satellite imagery to construct country-level time series of light intensity and extract summary measures of temporal variability. Using a binary classification framework, we assess whether these patterns differ systematically across countries, without attributing observed differences to specific causes.
